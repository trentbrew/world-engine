// anisotropicKuwahara — pass 2 of 2, and the one that does the painting.
//
// The Kuwahara filter, in one sentence: split the neighbourhood around a pixel
// into sectors, and take the average colour of whichever sector is the FLATTEST
// (lowest variance). Averaging smooths, but always picking the calmest sector
// means the smoothing never crosses an edge — so the image comes out as flat
// patches of colour meeting at hard boundaries, which is exactly what a loaded
// brush leaves behind. It is a blur that refuses to blur across contours.
//
// ANISOTROPIC is the second half. A circular kernel gives round, soap-bubble
// blobs — the tell of a naive Kuwahara. The structure tensor from pass 1 gives
// the local flow direction, and the kernel is rotated onto it and squeezed by
// how strongly the image flows there:
//
//   flat region  → anisotropy ≈ 0 → the kernel stays round
//   strong edge  → anisotropy ≈ 1 → the kernel stretches ALONG the edge
//
// so strokes follow the form the way a painter's do, and eaves and beams come
// out stroked along their length instead of dissolved into pebbles.
//
// Cost: SECTOR_COUNT × radius × 5 texture fetches per pixel. At the default
// 8 × 5 × 5 that is 200 samples — this is a heavy filter, and `radius` is the
// knob that pays for it.
//
// Adapted from Maxime Heckel's anisotropic Kuwahara implementation. Two
// deliberate departures from that source, both about where this one sits:
//
//   · No `fromLinear()`. That version writes straight to the screen and has to
//     encode sRGB itself; here the pass runs INSIDE postprocessing's composer,
//     which works in linear and lets the final EffectPass do the encoding. Doing
//     it here as well would gamma the image twice.
//   · No separate `originalTexture` render. That version renders the scene a
//     second time into an FBO to have an unfiltered copy to sample; in a proper
//     pass chain the composer's input buffer already IS that copy, so the scene
//     is rendered once.
